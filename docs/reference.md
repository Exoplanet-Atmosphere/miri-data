## Most important data for exoplanet composition
MIRI/SLIT <br>
NIRSpec/SLIT

file extension: <b> _x1d.fits</b>
* This is level 3 calibrated data - the most appropriate for determining exoplanet composition <br>
* Level 3 calibrated: 1D Extracted Spectra Data

## On Data For Each Exoplanet:
* Some exoplanets have both NIRSpec/SLIT and MIRI/SLIT Data
* Some only have one type of Data
    * In that case it is because the other type of data is not appropriate for the planet

## Access Data
Access JWST data manually: https://mast.stsci.edu/portal/Mashup/Clients/Mast/Portal.html <br>
* Use "Advanced Search" for the best results

Python API: <b> astroquery </b>
* Query Criteria filters are generally the same as Advanced Search filters
