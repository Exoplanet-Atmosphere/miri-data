Data Target: JWST - for exoplanet composition

Most important data for exoplanet composition
    MIRI/SLIT
    NIRSpec/SLIT

file extension: _x1d.fits
    This is level 3 calibrated data, the most appropriate for determining exoplanet composition
    3 calibrated: 1D Extracted Spectra Data

On NIRSPEC and MIRI SLIT data for planets
    Some exoplanets have both NIRSPEC/SLIT and MIRI/SLIT 1d Extracted Spectra Data, some only have one or the other
    If they only have one, then it is because the other was not appropriate for the exoplanet

Access Data
    Access JWST data through MAST manually: https://mast.stsci.edu/portal/Mashup/Clients/Mast/Portal.html
        use advanced search for the best results
    
    python library for data access: astroquery
        query_criteria filters are generally the same as advanced search filters
